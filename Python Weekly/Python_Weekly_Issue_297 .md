[How to Make a Digital Personality of Yourself Using Chatbots, Facebook Messages, and Empathy](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-make-a-digital-personality-of-yourself-using-chatbots-facebook-and-empathy-8b0c53afa9bd)  
This article sums up the culmination of my experiences researching and developing my senior thesis, an attempt to create a chatbot named Emoter that would have empathy (or some programmatic equivalent to it), at Parsons School of Design, deployed as an interactive exhibit in an art gallery. The experience didn't just leave me a better developer, but also with more insight on how the user experience of a chatbot should really feel, which will be the main point I address throughout the article.  
  
[Face Alignment with OpenCV and Python](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/05/22/face-alignment-with-opencv-and-python/ )  
The purpose of this post is to demonstrate how to align a face using OpenCV, Python, and facial landmarks. Given a set of facial landmarks (the input coordinates) our goal is to warp and transform the image to an output coordinate space.   
  
[Blue Green Deployment Using Amazon AWS and Python.](https://medium.com/practo-engineering/blue-green-deployment-on-amazon-aws-38b820518411)  
In Blue green deployment approach we create replica of the current production infrastructure and route all the traffic to the replica. The current infrastructure is termed as Blue while the replica is Green. Of course we make all code updates in the green fleet. This ensure high availability during deployments. This article is about implementing blue green deployment using Amazon AWS and Python. We will use Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2), Autoscaling Groups, Launch Configurations(LC), Elastic Load Balancer(ELB), Route 53, Python Boto and Python Fabric.

The notebook format that has been exemplified by the IPython/Jupyter project has gained in popularity among data scientists. While the existing formats have proven their value, they are still susceptible with difficulties in collaboration and maintainability. Scott Ernst created the Cauldron notebook to be testable, production ready, and friendly to version control. This week we explore the capabilities, use cases, and architecture of Cauldron and how you can start using it today!
